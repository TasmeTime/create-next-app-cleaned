# Cleaned (kinda) npx-create-next-app including styled-components and react icons

This is the npx-create-next-app's output with some files removed and `react-icons`, `styled-component` included.

There is a `GlobalStyle` defined and used in `pages/_app.js` which you can use to apply your global styles using styled-components.

Also there is a `Theme.js` file which you could use to define colors, breakpoints and use them across the project

1.`npm install`

2.`npm run dev`
